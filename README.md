[FunSearch](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/funsearch-making-new-discoveries-in-mathematical-sciences-using-large-language-models/) uses evolutionary search on python-code to find better functions. Because randomly changing the characters in python-code makes it unrunnable, we instead ask an LLM to slightly change the code.

## Setup

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), which automatically installs python and dependencies. Set your API-key using:
```sh
uv run llm keys set openai
```

## Running

Search for graphs on 35 vertices that have many edges but no 3-cycles or 4-cycles:

```sh
uv run funsearch run examples/3-4-cyclefree_spec.py 35
```

- The code generated by the LLM is executed in a sandbox, which defaults to running the code on your system and offers no protection from malicious code. If you have Docker or Podman, you can try passing `--sandbox_type ContainerSandbox` for safer sandboxing, see [jonppe's instructions](https://github.com/jonppe/funsearch/blob/745f2e7a61ef1418a95e09a009f2f65a3ce7c2ac/README.md).
- The LLM defaults to gpt-3.5-turbo and can be changed with `--model_name`. See `uv run llm models list` for available models.

See `uv run funsearch run --help` for more options.


## Inspecting Found Functions

Eventually abort the search with `ctrl+c`. Print the best functions:

```sh
# Inspect most recent backup:
uv run funsearch ls
# Inspect specific backup:
uv run funsearch ls data/backups/program_db_priority_1731323471_0.pickle
```
