# Iterative Rounding for the Gasoline Problem

This repository contains a python implementation of the Iterative Rounding algorithm for the Gasoline Problem based on [Gurobi solver](https://www.gurobi.com/).

The files `instance.py` and `generalised_instance.py` define the classes used to describing the instances and the linear model associated with the problem. In `iterative_rounding.py` is the implementation of the algorithm, both used for simple and generalised problem.
