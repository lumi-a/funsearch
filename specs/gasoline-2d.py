"""I'm trying to find instances of the gasoline-problem for which an iterative rounding algorithm has a poor (high) approximation-ratio in two dimensions.

The gasoline-problem looks for a permutation of the xs and ys (lists of points in â„•^2) such that maximum of the differences of prefix-sums is as small as possible, i.e. maximum_(m,n) zs[n]-zs[m] is as as small as possible, where zs[n] = xs[0] - ys[0] + xs[1] - ys[1] + ... + xs[n//2] - (ys[n] if n is odd else 0).

To generate sets with poor approximation-ratios, I have tried the following functions so far. Please write another one that is similar and has the same signature, but has some lines altered slightly.
